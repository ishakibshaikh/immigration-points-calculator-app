    Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark
    1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with his
    son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of the
    dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito flees
    his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his family.
    Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his wife and
    growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand Fanucci after he
    demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's
    communal stature grows.
